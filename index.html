            Hi, my name is Lisa and I am legally obligated to tell you about BIG.

            to teach you the entire point of your degree. If you stashed away 
            millions of dollars  under your mattress and were wondering what to do 
            with it, you can give it to me and that's a 
            Lisa Certified® Good Investment for You to Make™.
